* Optional Information -

  - To update static data entry (data.sql) file path
      
        src/main/resources/data.sql
  
  - Currently, reading static data entry access file under resources of project directory. if we want, we can update above properties based on requirenment.

      Example - data.sql file is available in the path - ...\src\main\resources\data.sql, and we can update this file if we want to update static properties like defining static book types along with discount percentage, defining promotion code and its validity etc...

  - Currently Static data file contains the static data entries of certain promotion/offer code and pre-fixed book type.
